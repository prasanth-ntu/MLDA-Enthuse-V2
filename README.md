## Steps to follow:
### Step 1a - Logging into Google Colab
** If you don't have a google account, skip to Step 1b **
- Go to [https://colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com)
- Sign in to your google account
- If you are new to google colab notebook, watch this Youtube video -  [Get started with Google Colaboratory (Coding TensorFlow)](https://youtu.be/inN8seMm7UI)

### Step 1b - Jupyter Notebook in Browser
** If the notebook disconnects/ dies often, consider Step 1c **
- Go to [https://jupyter.org/try](https://jupyter.org/try)
- Click on "Try Jupyter with Python". This will launch an online jupyter notebook using binder

### Step 1c - Jupyter Notebook Installation
- If you want to install jupyter notebook into your computer,
	- go to [https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/),
	- Download `Anaconda` and
	- Install it
	- Click `Start > Anaconda > Jupter Notebook` (in Windows)

### Step 2 - Opening a notebook
- Click `File > New Python 3 Notebook` to create a new `.ipynb` file online
- Wondering what's a notebook?
    - Think of it like a word document where you can write your python code, run and see the outputs, add comments and notes, insert images, etc. in one place.

### Step 3 - .csv file URL
- To directly load the .csv file into your current python program, copy the corresponding url shown below and paste it inside the command
    ```
    import pandas as pd
    pd.read_csv(###DATA_URL_HERE###)
    ```
